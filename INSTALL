CARLSIM INSTALLATION
========================================================================================================================

Use of CARLsim requires that the NVIDIA CUDA driver and NVIDIA CUDA SDK are installed and functional.

This code has been predominately developed under Linux and the build instructions reflect that.
While the code should function under MS Windows these instructions are not applicable. We will hopefully release
instructions in the future on how to setup the code base under Visual Studio on Windows based systems.



INSTALLING NVIDIA CUDA SDK
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download and install NVIDIA CUDA SDK from from: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads (see website for
platform-dependent installation instructions).

In order to run CARLsim, the cutil library must be compiled (libcutil). This can be achieved by compiling at least one
CUDA SDK example.



SETTING UP ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once that has been accomplished, you need to setup an environment variable that points to where the NVIDIA SDK is
located. So, under most linux systems do something like the following:

$ export NVIDIA_SDK=(SOME PATH)/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK

where (SOME PATH) is the actual path to the SDK on your system. The environment variable $NVIDIA_SDK will then be used
in the CARLsim Makefile to compile your network.

Also, make sure that the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH exists (should have been created during the installation
of CUDA SDK). On a 64-bit system this could look like this (however, depends on your CUDA install path):

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64

A good idea would be to add these two "export" lines to your ~/.bashrc, so you don't have to type every time you open
up a new terminal.



COMPILING AND RUNNING A NETWORK
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CARLsim software package contains a number of simulation examples, whose source code can be found under the
directory /examples/.

The following examples are available: colorblind, colorcycle, orientation, rdk, and v1MTLIP.

To run them, first compile one you desire by typing "make" followed by the name, such as:

$ make v1MTLIP

This will then create a binary file named as the experiment. Then type

$ ./v1MTLIP

and the simulation will start.
The results of the simulation (i.e., output spike files) will be stored in the directory /Results/v1MTLIP/.
Analysis scripts are available under /scripts/v1MTLIP/. Simply open MATLAB in that directory (or change MATLAB's
current directory to that) and run the script.

The rdk, orientation, and v1MTLIP examples can only be run on a system with a compatible GPU (compute capability 1.3
or higher). The colorblind example most likely must be run on CPU because at high spatial resolution it requires more
memory than most GPUs have available.
