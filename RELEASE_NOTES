CARLSIM RELEASE NOTES
---------------------

CARLsim is available from: http://socsci.uci.edu/~jkrichma/CARLsim/
CARLsim was written by: Jayram Moorkanikara Nageswaran (JN), Micah Richert (MDR)
CARLsim is maintained by: Mike Avery (MA), Michael Beyeler (MB), Kristofor Carlson (KDC)

CARLsim 1.2 (July 2013)
	* (MB) Added examples/main_V1MTLIP.cpp, scripts/V1MTLIP/
		complete source code to run motion energy model in COBA on CPU/GPU
	* (MB) Added option in CpuSNN::runNetwork to specify on which CUDA card to establish a context
		The first time you run sim.runNetwork() add an int ithGPU that specifies the device index.
		> bool onGPU=true; // GPU mode on
		> int ithGPU=2; // run on the third card
		> sim.runNetwork(0,0,onGPU?GPU_MODE:CPU_MODE,ithGPU);	
		If ithGPU is invalid (e.g., exceeds the number of cards), it defaults to using device 0.
	* (MB) Added GPU memory management summary in CpuSNN::allocateSNN_GPU
		At beginning of simulation, prints how many cards are available, which one has the most
		GFLOPs, on which card you're running your experiment, how much memory is available, etc.
	* (MB) Added functionality for scripts/common/readSpikes.m to return AER format
	* (MB) Added scripts/common/spikesAERtoFull.m
		Expands an AER-representation of <spike time/neuron ID> to a full matrix
	* (MB) Changed v1ColorME.cu to removed edge effects, reproduce V1 contrast sensitivity function,
		and feature scaling factors from Simoncelli & Heeger, 1998.
	* (MA/MB/KC) Changed max. firing rate from 1000 Hz to 520 Hz in config.h
	* (MB) Fixed CpuSNN::printSimSummary: number of (actual vs. allocated) synapses
	* (MB) Fixed GPU memory allocation for fixed-weight simulations in snn_gpu.cu
	* (MB) Fixed storing of current[] when running COBA in CPU mode in CpuSNN::globalStateUpdate
	* (MB) Fixed integer overflow issues for largest-scale simulations in snn_cpu.cpp
	* (MB) Fixed indexing issue in scripts/common/readNetwork.m
	* (MB) Workaround for COBA instability issue: conductances are capped to prevent instability 
		in CpuSNN::globalStateUpdate
