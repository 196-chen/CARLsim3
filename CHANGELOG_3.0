	  at any time, specifying where to store the data and whether to include
	  synaptic info (weights, delays, etc.).
	  By default, saveSimulation is called in the destructor of CARLsim. This
	  will save general information about the simulation and the network setup,
	  but will not include all the nitty-gritty synapse details.
	+ Added setDefaultSaveOptions, which allows the user to change the default
	  location etc. of the saveSimulation file.
	* Changed Matlab script readNetwork to loadSimulation.
	* Fixed -nan bug in printSimSummary.

	  that lets you generate 2D visual stimuli, add noise to them, confine
	  them to an aperture, and store them in binary files) and a corresponding
	  C++ class that reads the binary files and converts them to raw char
	  arrays or mean firing rates of PoissonRate objects.

2014-04-10     Ting-Shuo Chou <tingshuc@uci.edu>

	  interface.

	+ added logger mode SHOWTIME

2014-03-17     Kristofor D. Carlson <kdcarlso@uci.edu>
	* carlsim_tests.mk: reorganized this file to support the implementation
	  of CARLsim google tests in different source files instead of a single
	  large source file.
	+ gtest_custom_main.cpp: created this file as a custom implementation
	  of a google tests main function. This allows us to control the output
	  of google tests easier.
	+ CHANGELOG_2.3: Added this CHANGELOG file to keep track of changes as
	  we make them. We can then more easily write a CHANGELOG file when we
	  release the code.


2013-03-22     Michael Beyeler <mbeyeler@uci.edu>
	* examples: reorganized files such that all source files, video files, and
	  scripts of a specific example go in examples/. Fixed dynamic allocation.
