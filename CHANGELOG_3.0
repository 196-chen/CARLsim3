	* Fixed the tuneFiringRates example to work with the new CARLsim/pti
	interface.
	* Changed CHANGELOG_2.3 to CHANGELOG_3.0.
	* Cleaned up Makefile and carlsim.mk a bit.

2014-03-17     Kristofor D. Carlson <kdcarlso@uci.edu>
	* carlsim_tests.mk: reorganized this file to support the implementation
	  of CARLsim google tests in different source files instead of a single
	  large source file.
	* gtest_custom_main.cpp: created this file as a custom implementation
	  of a google tests main function. This allows us to control the output
	  of google tests easier.
	* CHANGELOG_2.3: Added this CHANGELOG file to keep track of changes as
	  we make them. We can then more easily write a CHANGELOG file when we
	  release the code.


2013-03-22     Michael Beyeler <mbeyeler@uci.edu>
	* examples: reorganized files such that all source files, video files, and
	  scripts of a specific example go in examples/. Fixed dynamic allocation.
