\section tut3s1_overview 3.1 Overview
Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a popular learning rule in spiking neural networks
(SNNs). STDP was first found in neurons in 1997 and is still under intense study (Sjöström
Gerstner (2010)). SNNs are a unique class of neural network (NN) models that capture the
temporal dynamics (spike times) of the network. Because of this, they are ideally sutied to
implement STDP. However, STDP can often undergo 'runaway potentiation' or 'runaaway depotentiation'
where the synaptic weights increase or decrease without bound, respectively. To avoid this, CARLsim
users can utilize a model of homeostatic synaptic scaling implemented in CARLsim. The homeostatic
synaptic scaling model (Carlson et al., 2014) is biologically plausible and works as follows. The
average firing rate of each neuron is calculated over a time period on the scale of minutes to
hours. This average firing rate is compared to a user-defined target firing rate and the difference
between these firing rates is used to scale all synapses on that neuron up or down multiplicatively.
For instance, if a neuron has an average firing rate of 10 Hz and a target firing rate of 20 Hz, it
will scale up all postsynaptic weights on that neuron in an effort to attain the target firing rate.

In this tutorial, we will show users how to configure and enable both STDP and homeostasis in a
simple model. This tutorial does not currently cover using short-term plasticity (STP). For more
information on STP, please see: \ref ch5s1_short_term_plasticity. The network we construct will have
100 Poisson input neurons connected to a single regular spiking (RS) output neuron. Every synaptic
connection between the input neurons and the output neuron will be plastic and have both STDP and
homeostasis enabled. Each input neuron will be assigned a different input firing rate in ascending
order from 0.2 Hz to 20 Hz. The synaptic weights will be randomly initialized and the simulation
will then run for 1000 seconds. The spike and synaptic
weight data will be visualized using the MATLAB OAT scripts provided in the:
<tt>%%%CARLSIM_ROOT_DIR%%/doc/source/tutorial/3_plasticity/scripts</tt>. Users will see that
homeostasis can successfully stabilize STDP by visualizing the weights before and after the 1000
seconds of simulation.


\section tut3s2_network_setup 3.2 Network Setup

As always, the first step in setting up a CARLsim program is to include the <tt>libCARLsim</tt>
library. We also include the vector library because we will be using the vector data structure.

\code
#include <carlsim.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
\endcode

\section tut3s2s1_config 3.2.1 CARLsim Program CONFIG State

We first construct a simple SNN that has 100 Poisson input neurons (group ID = gPoiss) all connected
to a single regular spiking (RS) Izhikevich output neuron (group ID = gExc) as shown below. Notice
we passed the GPU_MODE argument in our CARLsim constructor call. This means our simulation will take
place on the GPU. Also notice that the last argument for CARLsim::createSpikeGeneratorGroup is
EXCITATORY_POISSON and not EXCITATORY_NEURON. The setNeuronParameters call assigns the RS spiking
neuron parameter values to all neurons in the gExc group.

\code
// ---------------- CONFIG STATE -------------------
// create a network with nPois Poisson neurons and nExc excitatory output
// neurons
CARLsim sim("plasticity simulation", GPU_MODE, USER);
int nPois = 100; // 100 input neurons
int nExc  = 1;   // 1 output neuron

// set up our neuron groups
int gPois = sim.createSpikeGeneratorGroup("input", nPois, EXCITATORY_POISSON);
int gExc  = sim.createGroup("output", nExc, EXCITATORY_NEURON);
sim.setNeuronParameters(gExc, 0.02f, 0.2f, -65.0f, 8.0f);
\endcode

We next connect neurons from the gPoiss group to neurons (just one for now) in the gExc group with
full connectivity with a minimum weight value of 0.0, an initial value of 1.0f/100, and a maximum
value of 20.0f/100. The connection probability is given as 1.0f, a delay of 1 is used for all
synapses, and no receptive fields are specified (-1). Finally, the keyword 'SYN_PLASTIC' is used
instead of 'SYN_FIXED' to enable plasticity for this connection. This is required. Also, set this
simulation to use conductances with default parameter values with the CARLsim::setConductances call.

\code
// connect our groups with SYN_PLASTIC as the final argument.
sim.connect(gPois, gExc,  "full", 0.01f, 0.03f, 1.0, 1, 1, SYN_PLASTIC);

// set conductances with default values
sim.setConductances(true);
\endcode

A PoissonRate object is then created to use as an input to a SpikeGenerator group. It is the same
size of as the SpikeGenerator group and is allocated on the GPU for efficiency.

\code
// create PoissonRate object of size nPoiss.
PoissonRate poissRate(nPois, true); // allocate on GPU for minimal memory copies
\endcode

Next, enable excitatory STDP (E-STDP) with a call to CARLsim::setESTDP pass the postsynaptic group
you want to enable it for and 'true' to enable it. Additionally, the 'STANDARD' keyword indicates
that there will not be a neuromodulatory influence at this synapse. Finally, the STDP curve type is
specified by passing the stdpCurve_t data type with the desired STDP parameters.
alpha_LTP(alpha_LTD) represents the magnitude of the increase(decrease) in synaptic weight while
tau_LTP(tau_LTD) represents the time constant, which defines the width of the LTP(LTD) curve with
respect to time. Notice that alpha_LTD is passed as being negative. The alpha_ltp and alpha_ltd
parameters are allowed to be positive or negative depending on the user's preference. This allows
users to build the many different type of EXP_CURVE type STDP curves found in \ref
\ref ch5s2_spike_timing_dependent_plasticity, Fig. 2(a-d) and 2(f-i). The tau_LTP/tau_LTD
parameters, however, cannot be negative as they are time constants.

\code
// set E-STDP parameters.
float alpha_LTP=0.001f/100; float tau_LTP=20.0f;
float alpha_LTD=0.0015f/100; float tau_LTD=20.0f;

// set E-STDP to be STANDARD (without neuromodulatory influence) with an EXP_CURVE type.
sim.setESTDP(gExc, true, STANDARD, ExpCurve(alpha_LTP, tau_LTP, -alpha_LTD, tau_LTP));
\endcode

It should be noted that the function call CARLsim::setSTDP could have replaced the CARLsim::setESTDP
function call, as it is a wrapper for this function call. However, the CARLsim::setESTDP is
unambiguous and is therefore the preferred method.

Homeostatic synaptic scaling parameters are next defined. The homeostatic scaling factor
(homeoScale) defines how large the effect of homeostasis will have the synaptic weight change.
The synaptic weight change is composed of two terms, the homeostatic term and the STDP term. Each
term has a scaling factor associated with it. The STDP scaling term has a value of 1. Therefore,
to give the homeostatic term a larger influence than the STDP term, increase the homeostatic
scaling factor to a value greater than 1. The homeostatic time constant (avgTimeScale) term defines
the length of time over which the average firing rate of neurons in this group are calculated during
the homeostasis calculation. Finally the target firing rate (targetFiringRate) term defines the
firing rate the neurons in the group will attempt to attain.

\code
// homeostasis constants
float homeoScale= 1.0; // homeostatic scaling factor
float avgTimeScale = 5.0; // homeostatic time constant
float targetFiringRate = 35.0;
\endcode

To enable homeostasis, the CARLsim::setHomeostasis function is called with the postsynaptic group as
the first argument, a boolean flag that enables/disables homeostasis as a the second argument, the
homeostatic synaptic scaling constant as the third argument, and the homeostatic time constant as
the fourth argument. The CARLsim::setHomeostasis function can be called with just the first two
arguments, in which case the default values of homeoScale = 0.1 and avgTimeScale = 10 will be used.
When homeostasis is enabled, users must also define the target firing rate neurons in the group.
This is done with a call to CARLsim::setHomeoBaseFiringRate, where the postsynaptic group, value of
the targetFiringRate, and the standard deviation of the targetFiringRate are specified by the user.
Please note that the target firing rate is calculated once at the beginning of the simulation and
remains the same throughout the simulation.

\code
sim.setHomeostasis(gExc,true,homeoScale,avgTimeScale);
sim.setHomeoBaseFiringRate(gExc,targetFiringRate,0);
\endcode

\section tut3s2s2_setup 3.2.2 CARLsim Program SETUP State

During the SETUP state of CARLsim, CARLsim::setupNetwork is called. Two SpikeMonitor pointers are
called and assigned SpikeMonitor objects created with the CARLsim::setSpikeMonitor function call.
The first argument to these functions are the group for which the spike data will be recorded while
the second argument is the filename of the spike data files. The argument of "DEFAULT" denotes that
the default filename conventions will be used, namely: "results/spk_{group name}.dat".


\code
// ---------------- SETUP STATE -------------------
sim.setupNetwork();
SpikeMonitor* SpikeMonInput  = sim.setSpikeMonitor(gPois,"DEFAULT");
SpikeMonitor* SpikeMonOutput = sim.setSpikeMonitor(gExc,"DEFAULT");
\endcode


\section tut3s2s3_run 3.2.3 CARLsim Program RUN State

During the RUN state, we set the firing rates of each of the nPois (100) neurons. We assing the
first input neuron an average firing rate of 0.2 Hz, the second input neuron an average firing rate
of 0.4 Hz, and so on. This gives our 100th input a neuron an average firing rate of 20 Hz. We can
now observe the weight change at each input/output synapse as a function of the average firing rate
of the input neurons each having Poisson firing statistics.

We first generate a vector that contains the average firing rate for each Poisson neuron with the
following code:

\code
// ---------------- RUN STATE -------------------
// set rate of each neuron
std::vector <float> rates;
for (int i=0; i<nPois; i++)
	rates.push_back((i+1)*(20.0/100));
\endcode

The vector is then passed to the PoissRate object with the following call:

\code
poissRate.setRates(rates);
\endcode

Finally,

\section tut3s3_network_output 3.3 Network Output

\section tut3s4_network_vis 3.4 Network Visualization

In order to plot network activity and observe weight changes in the network, we will make use of the
MATLAB Offline Analysis Toolbox (OAT) (see \ref ch9_matlab_oat).

The Tutorial subdirectory <tt>"scripts/"</tt> provides a MATLAB script <tt>"scripts/demoOAT.m"</tt> to
demonstrate the usage of the OAT.
The script looks like this:
\code
% OAT demo

% first, init OAT by adding path
initOAT

% second, open a NetworkMonitor on the simulation file
% and plot the activity of the network
NM = NetworkMonitor('../results/sim_spnet.dat')
NM.plot

% third, observe weight changes in the network
CM0 = ConnectionMonitor('exc','exc','../results')
CM0.plot('histogram')

CM1 = ConnectionMonitor('inh','exc','../results')
CM1.plot('histogram')
\endcode

After adding the location of the OAT source code to the MATLAB path, a NetworkMonitor is opened on the
simulation file <tt>"../results/sim_spnet.dat"</tt>, which was automatically created during the CARLsim
simulation (note that the string "spnet" corresponds to the name given to the network in the CARLsim constructor).

Calling the <tt>plot</tt> method will then visualize network activity using default settings and a plot type
that depends on the spatial structure of the neuron groups.
Since the network does not have any particular spatial structure, the default plot type is a raster plot,
shown in frames of 1000ms, as seen in Fig. 1 below.

\code
\image html 2_nm_raster.jpg "Fig. 1. NetworkMonitor output for groups 'exc' and 'inh' (raster plot)"
\endcode

Fig. 2 shows the temporal evolution of weights from the recurrent excitatory connection on <tt>gExc</tt>.
At the beginning of the experiment (leftmost panel), all weights are initialized to <tt>6.0f</tt>.
Over time, these values start to diverge, but stay confined in the range <tt>[0.0f, 10.0f]</tt>.

\code
\image html 2_cm_hist.jpg "Fig. 2. ConnectionMonitor output for the connection 'exc'=>'exc' (histogram)"
\endcode

Similar behavior can be observed on the connection from <tt>gInh</tt> to <tt>gExc</tt>.

It would also be possible to open a ConnectionMonitor on the fixed connection from <tt>gExc</tt> to <tt>gInh</tt>,
but the expected output would be similar to the leftmost panel of Fig. 2, showing all weights initialized to
<tt>5.0f</tt>, with no weight changes to report over time.
